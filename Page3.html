   <h2>SermX</h2>
    <p>SermX is a fun project I am currently working and have been working on for the past few months, it is a sermon creation tool to give people an <br>
        easyer and more efficient way to create and build sermons. It has a rich graphical interface and uses the CKeditor editor for a <br> 
        remarkably way to edit text. I also have a scripture search from the <b>Bible group API</b> and a Give it to god feature that will give you a random version to use in your sermons.
        <br>
